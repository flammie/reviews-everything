# Flammie reviews: Agenturet Øl og Vinbar

Agenturet is a craft beer and wine bar with a great selection of
beers and probably wines as well though that is not something I know
much about. The restaurant is quite cosy and nice to hang out at, the
service is good and other customers are ok, it's not too rowdy even on
weekends, though I prefer  visiting on weekdays for few after work pints
or on Sundays. The bar has often been quite full but they've recently
reorganised so there should be more space now.
