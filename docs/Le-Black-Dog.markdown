# Flammie reviews: Le Black Dog

One of the few metal pubs I managed to find in Paris, the metal they play
is really nice, not the obvious hit songs or radio-friendly rock anything
like that. Nice selection of beers, nothing spectacular but better than
average dive bar or cafe around. The service is I think typical to Paris,
not super-friendly or polite but works fast. The bar has plenty of room
inside and it's also in the neighbourhood where there are a lot of bars
to visit if you want to hop around.
