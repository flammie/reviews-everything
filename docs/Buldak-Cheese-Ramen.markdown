# Flammie Reviews: Buldak Cheese

Buldak Cheese is a cheese flavoured version of Samyang's legendarily good
*artificial spicy chicken flavour ramen*. Cheese as an ingredient of ramen is
relatively recent innovation but it works surprisingly well and also smooths
down the world's spiciest ramen flavour, retaining most of the tastiness for
those who cannot handle the heat so well. It is still spicy, but probably
palatable to most people even who aren't chiliheads.
