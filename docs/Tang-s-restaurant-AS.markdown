# Flammie reviews: Tang's restaurant AS

It's what I would call old style European Chinese food, even the
decoration reminds you of all the Chinese restaurants that started in
Europe 1980s and 1990s. I am not sure how to review it fairly, if you
like Europeanised Chinese food you will probably enjoy this restaurant;
I am kind of self-entitled food snob who was visited China, and tasting
Szechuan foods that are sweet and lightly spaced is not my thing. For
the price it is decent and portions are nice, and the service is nice,
if you don't come in with expectations of authentic szechuan food,
you should be fine.
