# Flammie reviews everything

This website contains *reviews* made by [Flammie](../), some made specifally for
this website and some rescued from other websites, as I realise that I
[shouldn't rely on googles](google-fails.html) and tripadvisors to archive my
valuable reviews and ratings, and I want to organise them myself and so on and
so forth. So that's why I made this website and accompanying content management
system called: *Flammie reviews everything*

Sure I am not the best writer in the world or expert of all things but you know,
it's good archive for myself for reference, often when shopping, travelling or
debating on the net; the older I get the less I remember what I actually know
about things.
