# Flammie reviews everything

This website contains *reviews* made by [Flammie](../), some made
specifally for this website and some rescued from other websites, as
I realise that I shouldn't rely on googles and tripadvisors to archive
my valuable reviews and ratings, and I want to organise them myself and
so on and so forth. So that's why I made this website and accompanying
content management system called: *Flammie reviews everything*
