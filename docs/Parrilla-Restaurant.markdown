# Flammie reviews: Parrilla Restaurant

It's a cheap kebab shop and if you go in with that as your baseline
expectation you are probably going to be satisfied. They serve kebabs,
hamburgers and pizzas that are relatively cheap, as much as it can be
for Norwegian prices. The kebab meat is ok, it's not very seasoned,
but it's better than frozen supermarket kebab for example. Perfect
for hangover meals or filling up before a night out. The sign outside
the shop says Mexican food, I am guessing this plays into the European
idea that adding pickled jalapeños and sweetcorn to anything makes it
Mexican–a bit like adding pineapple makes food Hawaiian–but the food
is really just basic European pizza-kebab.
