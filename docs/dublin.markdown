# Flammie’s Dublin

Dublin is the capital of Republic of Ireland and I used to live there around
2010–2015. Very touristic and often overpriced. Touristic party area is in
**Temple bar**, however, it's often more nicer and affordable in other areas,
e.g. crossing the river to **Dublin 2** area instead. Same kinds of bars but
slightly fewer tourists.

I notice that Google maps reviews wasn't so much a thing back in the years I
lived there. Here's an overview anyways.

## Restaurant

* [CrackBird](CrackBird-South-William.html), chicken wings, best of Dublin but
  still kind of mid
* [Lee’s Charming Noodles](Lee-s-Charming-Noodles.html), Chinese, ok but nothing
  special


## Bars

* Fibber Magees, rock and metal
*
