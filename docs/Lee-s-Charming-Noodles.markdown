# Flammie reviews: Lee's Charming Noodles

I tried the Szechuan chow mein, waitress warned that it would be spicy
but it was rather mild. The portion was huge but the noodles were kind of
soggy and plate was soaked in oil. Still kind of reminded of me what I
had in China. 10 euros is too much for such basic dish, there's a dozen
of chinese around that provide better value. The meal came within few
minutes from ordering, don't know if it's good or bad.
