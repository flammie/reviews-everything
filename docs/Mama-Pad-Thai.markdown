# Flammie reviews: Mama Pad Thai

Mama's pad thai rice noodle dish *Pho Kho Pad Thai an len* is a decent
rice instant noodle, a bit sweet to my taste but not bad, could use
more spice to overcome the sweetness of the flavour. In general not as
good as some other Mama's instant noodles but in the category of rice
noodles is quite alright, partially because I haven't found that much
competition for grading yet (the fact that I do not remember outstanding
rice noodle instant noodles suggests maybe there aren't that many).
