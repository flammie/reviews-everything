# Flammie reviews: Grotte Rockbar

This is my regular hangout, one of the metal bars in Hamburg. It's quite
small fitting around 15 people at once with two tables and a bar. The
music depends on the bartender but is typically a mix of hard rock, metal
and American metal. Like most places in Reeperbahn this is a smoking
bar and being a small place downstairs it'll be smoky most of the time.
