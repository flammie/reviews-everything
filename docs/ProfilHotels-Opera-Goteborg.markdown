# Flammie reviews: ProfilHotels Opera Göteborg

ProfilHotels Opera is right across the street from railway station. It
is advertised as four star hotel and it looks fancy from outside and
does have all the services. The hotel and rooms are outdated, we bought
an upgrade to newer larger room and it was still very outdated and with a
tiny bed, I am actually kind of worried what the smaller room with smaller
bed would have been even. That being said the room was ok for sleeping and
location was good, the breakfast was excellent and since I got it quite
cheap it was well worth the money, but if it had been an average price
for four star hotel in Sweden I would have been seriously disappointed.
