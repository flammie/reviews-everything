This console version includes two games, first of which is apparently originally an entry in a time-limited game development contest. It has probably been finalised after the contest, while the game is still quite short, it plays very well and there is no signs of rushed development, the second game is more full and takes more time to finish. The games are both based on paying a homage to popular console games, many of the gameplay mechanics (or all of them) are directly cloned from popular series and the game makes no attempts to hide this. The stories are well-made and enjoyable with good sense humour. One of the biggest problems for me is that the difficulty is all over the place between different game mechanics and not all control equally well. For example few platforming sections control not so tightly and are overly long with frustrating instant death pits. The game crashes way too much for a released console game, while it 9 out of 10 times manages to start exactly at the spot where it crashed, it is still annoying to restart every few hours. Altogether a really nice package of retro nostalgia that is only slightly let down by few not so good sections that overstay their retro-welcome, and crashiness.&hellip; Expand
