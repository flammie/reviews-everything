# Flammie reviews: Zebra Hostel

I was only visiing on my way to Linate on early morning flight, but the
common space and the bar is really nice, the hostel is located almost
centrally and the staff speak good English and are really helpful. Now,
I travel a lot and am used to hostels, but I am also getting older,
and I have a feeling this hostel mainly gathers to younger clientele,
teens and early twenties, based on the music and all over contemporary
/ hipster feel of the place. The rooms are not as nice as the common
area, the floor is rather dirty and tiles make it look like a bathroom
floor. Walls between 16 people rooms are open from the top, so you can
hear and smell worth of at least 32 people at nights. Also slightly
on the expensive side but there aren't too many options in Milan for
backpackers even now.
