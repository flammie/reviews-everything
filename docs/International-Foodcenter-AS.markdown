# Flammie reviews: International Foodcenter AS

International foodcenter is one of the Asian food stores in town, it's
not the biggest or so but has some things in their selection that is not
found in other stores. Usually good for Indian, East Asian and Mexican
ingredients in my experience, for example dried chilis for mexican food
I have not found elsewhere. Unlike many of the reviewers, I find the
service just fine and have not had any problems.
