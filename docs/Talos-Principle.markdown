# Flammie reviews: Talos Principle

Talos principle is a great 3d puzzle game, based on manipulation of few simple
objects like blocks and coloured beams. There is an overarching plot with kind
of religious hints here and there as well as AI future and few other plotlines
that you basically have to piece together from text messages and communicating
via computer. The puzzles are really good, like it's been years since I've found
game challenging but not unfair like this, very few puzzles have any running or
platforming components, they are generally solvable by just figuring it out.
Closest game I can think of is maybe portal 2. Music is ok in the background,
not very memorable but appropriate. The switch port specifically suffers from
lot of slowdowns which is a bit annoying since the graphics aren't really that
amazing or anything.


★★★★★★★★★☆ (9 out of 10)
