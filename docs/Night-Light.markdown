# Flammie reviews: Night Light

It's one of my favourite metal hangout bars in Hamburg, I've been living
here for a while now and still go there time to time. It's small but nnot
that packed most of the time, beer's cheap as everywhere, music is good,
very often actual real heavy metal and not just top10 from mtv heavy
metal, dj's are nice too and can play stuff.
