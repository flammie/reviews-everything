# Flammie reviews: CrackBird South William

I was recommended crackbird as a place to go for good wings in Dublin,
so my expectations were quite high. However, I found that the wings were
nothing special, juicy but a bit tough, so not the best ever really. I had
habanero and honey wings, and while they were tasty, I didn't get even
a bit of heat which I would expect from wings in general and especially
one labelled with habanero. Even my friend who does not eat any spicy
food at all liked it and had a couple. The atmosphere is typical hipstery
contemporary, service is very good. I didn't get wet wipes or even extra
napkins, you'd really expect this to be basics for a place specialising
on chicken wings.
