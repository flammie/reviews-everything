This is the first time I have used a console sports game and actually felt having exercised like a proper gym exercises, at times even more so. And I am one of the many people who are not particularly sporty, it is exactly what we have been expecting for from fitness games for a long time. It is unreal how well does it motivate to do more squats than you'd think you can just so you can kill some monsters, I'd never do that in a gym. The only down side I can say is that some of the moves are badly designed, and you need to watch multiple youtube videos to understand how to do them correctly since the motion sensors don't help you enough or even misguide you. Many yoga moves being the worst offenders, doing them in smooth, correct motion will give you fewer points than yanky slow motion. I've played it for exactly a year now, lost weight and gained muscles (just a little bit, let's be honest), and am just now finishing the main story quest–I think. So one year averaging 4 times a week, it's well worth any money.&hellip; Expand
