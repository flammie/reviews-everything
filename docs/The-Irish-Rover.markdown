# Flammie reviews: The Irish Rover

This is among more authentic Irish pubs I've seen, saying by experience of
living in Dublin for two years. This is also the style of pubs I enjoy,
drinking and socialising, includes of course obligatory selection of
sports on the telly but that is avoidable if needed. Sometimes hosts
events downstairs like poetry, live music etc.
