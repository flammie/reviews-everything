# Flammie reviews: CİHANGİR PALACE HOTEL

Cihangir palace is a cheap hotel near taksim square, the rooms are quite
ok and modern. However, the hotel has some problems with electricity,
so modern rooms and AC do not help much, and what I could gather from the
hotel staff's responses is that this electricity problems are regular and
fixes itself by waiting (\"it happens, just wait a few hours\"). We were
total of one night without electricity and AC and of course most of the
breakfast was inaccessible next morning as well, and the elevator. Without
these problems on the other day, the breakfast was nice and rooms were
good as well.
