# Flammie reviews: Buldak Carbonara

Buldak Carbonara is one of the variations of their spiciest noodle in
the world. The spiciness in this version is reduced by the cheesy powder
which works surprisingly well, it is still quite spicy but probably more
edible for people who are not so extreme with their chili loving. If
you compare this to Cheese version I cannot say I would remember huge
difference between these two; they are both cheesy and cheese is the
main additional flavour. I would have to taste them side by side to
figure out the differences but I cannot see that happening very soon.
