# Flammie on hotels

This is a listing of hotels I have visited and reviewed and short note on
whether I'd go again. Many of the hotels are chain hotels which tend to be
approx. same quality everywhere in the world, here's a short overview:

1. Discount hotels: no extras, no breakfasts, checkin machine or minimal
   service, cheap and good quality: B&B Hotels, Ibis budget, A&O Hostels,
   Omena (Finland), Forenom...
1. Basic to high brands: Checkin service, breakfast, sometimes pools and gyms
   etc., doable if cheap: Ibis, Holiday Inn, Scandic, Comfort Xpress, Mercure,
   Smarthotel, ...

The deciding factors in these chains is more the walking distance / public
transport combined with price than anything else, the rooms are always the same
and it's good enough for me for all of these chains.

# München (Munich)

* [B&B München city west](B-B-HOTEL-Munchen-City-West.html), ok, bit far

# Praha (Prague)

* [B&B Prague City](B-B-Hotel-Prague-City.html), great and

# Istanbul

* [Cihangir palace](CIHANGIR-PALACE-HOTEL.html), avoid, problems with
  electricity and everythings

# Stockholm

* [Comfort Xpress Stockholm
  Central](Comfort-Hotel-Xpress-Stockholm-Central.html), very central, rooms are
  ridiculously tiny
* [Hotell Skeppsbron](Hotell-Skeppsbron.html), cheap, at the edge of old town so
  reachable if not the best location for most tourism or bars, ok-ish

# Budapest

Currently I'd recommend renting an apartment (not airbnb or booking.com) if
possible, is often cheaper and nicer.

* [Golden Park](Golden-Park-Hotel.html), maybe avoid, cheap and central but
  really run down

# Las Vegas

Any casino on strip or Fremont street should be just fine.

* ~~[Hard Rock Casino](Hard-Rock-Hotel-Casino-Las-Vegas.html) was nice, off
  strip and cheap, but discontinued

# Uttrecht

* [Hello B&B](Hello-B-B.html) was a traditional B&B I had to use because it was
  only thing cheap enough for university's budget, nice people though

# Helsinki

* [Hotel Arthur](Hotel-Arthur.html) is terribly run-down and expensive but
  right next to linguistics at the University

# Варна (Varna)

* [Belle Epoque](Hotel-Belle-Epoque-Beach.html), avoid, cheap but not good

# Lisbon

* [Hotel Star Inn at airport](Hotel-Star-Inn-Lisbon-Airport.html), nice airport
  hotel, walkable

* [Hotel Stern](Hotel-Stern.html), cheap and central-ish, okay

# Bergen

* [Magic Hotel Solheimsviken](Magic-Hotel-Solheimsviken.html), cheap and nice
  hotel, few tram stops or long walk from city centre
* [Scandic Kokstad](Scandic-Kokstad.html), airport hotel, not walkable and a bit
  of walk after tram as well

# Gdańsk

* [Sleep&Fly](Sleep-Fly.html), airport hotel, walkable and cheap, perfect for
  wizzair–ryanair layovers

* [Ocean Spray](Ocean-Spray-Hotel.html), short walk from beach and ok, probably
  better than the most beach front hotels

* [PH Opera](ProfilHotels-Opera.html), cheap but surprisingly rundown and small
  rooms for what tries to be higher end hotel, near railway station
