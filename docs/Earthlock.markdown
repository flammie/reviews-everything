The plot is interesting enough to carry through the game, though a lot of side quest content is very basic fetch quests, and repeated ones for no real reason than to extend the time waste. One of the biggest problems is that while the characters have a bit of personality, this is not developed efficiently enough in the game plot throughout so the plot is just slightly above average; one of the typical problems of indie games is that you never see expressions of the characters, so they end up seeming plain and motionless. The difficulty kind of spikes in the boss battles and few points here and there, but e.g. all boss battles are doable by learning some special tactic. Dungeon and map design is good, only few of the dungeons towards end game feel stretched for no reason, but ok. Much plus points for Norwegian translation, I wish more companies would do this more often, I love learning languages and Norwegian happens to be on my todo list.&hellip; Expand
