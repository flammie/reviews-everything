# Flammie reviews: Köz Urfa

This neighbourhood is full of Turkish restaurants, but I think Köz Urfa
is one of the better ones. Portions are great for good price, and the
selection includes a lot of dishes that I have eaten e.g. in Istanbul
so I would dare to say some authentic food is being served here. Great
service as well, always been very nice experience.
