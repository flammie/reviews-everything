# Flammie’s metal travel guide

Metal travel guide used to be a website cataloguing all the worthwhile metal
bars and music shops around the world. Then came social medias and Internet web
sites weren't used anymore. Here's a list of metal bars I have visited and can
recommend or warn about.

# United Kingdom

## London

Probably the metallest area is Camden, though very gentrified these days.

1. Black Heart
1. Dev (ex Hobgoblin, ex Devonshire Arms)

## Glasgow

1. [Rufus T Firefly](Rufus-T-Firefly.html), good bar, plays metal

# Germany

Germany is quite metally country but finding a metal bar can be a bit of an
effort these days. Most cities will have some but not necessarily central.

## Berlin

The metallest area still is Friedrichshain.

1. [Paule's Metal Eck](Paule-s-Metal-Eck.html), good bar, plays metal, classic,
  avoid when football or sports
1. Halford

## Hamburg

I lived in Hamburg 2014–2020, great metal scene, usually always concerts and
bars. The centre of nightlife, including metal, is at Reeperbahn.

1. [Night Light](Night-Light.html), great bar, plays metal, only opens on
   weekends but worth a visit
1. [Lunacy](Lunacy.html), ok bar, usually metal
1. [Bambi Galore](Bambi-galore.html), venue, usually metal
1. [Hörnerfest](Hornerfest.html), festival, local train trip away around

1. [Headcrash](Headcrash.html), venue, rarely metal, usually avoid
1. ~~[Grotte](Grotte-Rockbar.html), great metal bar, unfortunately gone~~

## München (Munich)

1. [HopDog](HopDog.html), great bar, good food, sometimes nmetal
1. [Abseits](Abseits.html), good bar, plays metal, **no** card payment!

# Turkey

## Istanbul

Both Taksim area in the European side and Kadiköy on the Asian side have some
night life. My last visit, the Asian side was nicer.

1. [Wizard](Wizard-Pub.html), great bar, plays metal,
1. [Dorock](Dorock-Heavy-Metal-Club.html), good bar, concert venue,
   usually metal

# Norway

You'd think Norway as a metal country but it really doesn't have much metal bar
culture going around. Biggest cities will usually have a metal bar.

## Bergen

1. [Kraken](Kraken.html), good bar, plays metal

## Tromsø

I live in Tromsø 2020–, not much of a metal scene, we take every concert we can
and support the bars that play any metal.

1. [Bastard](Bastard-Bar.html), good bar, every now and then metal (but probably
   best in town anyways)
1. Blå Rock, good burgers, not really metal at all

# Sweden

Most cities in Sweden will have some metal bars.

## Stockholm

1. Anchor, usually metal, often crowded and often rude bouncers

## Gothenburg

1. [Rockbaren](Rockbaren.html), decent bar, plays metal


# Hungary

## Budapest

1. [Paranoir](ParaNoir-Pub.html), ok bar, plays metal-ish, odd opening times,
1. [Barba Negra (track, ...)](Barba-Negra.html), metal venue, seems to be in different place
   every time, check the booking site

Finland is surprisingly metally so you wouldn't be surprised to have metal
playing in an average sports bar, main stream pub or so. Just the most obvious
hits usually but good enough.

## Helsinki

1. Base
1. [Praha](Praha.html), good bar, plays metal
