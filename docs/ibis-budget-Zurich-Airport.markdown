# Flammie reviews: ibis budget Zurich Airport

ibis budget Zurich Airport is a typical and trustworthy budget ibis
experience, less than 5 minutes on a tram from the airport and probably
perfectly walkable too. The room is space-effective and good for your
typical overnight for layovers. There's snacks and beers sold at the
reception, service is super nice.
