# Flammie reviews: Crossroads

Rather slow and rude service. I waited 10 minutes then went to counter
and the server asked if I wanted to pay, I was sent back to table
to wait another ten minutes, no apologies at any time. I ordered a
Nordic soup. Menu said habanero, coriander, not sure which Nordic that
is. Main flavour of soup is store bought chicken stock, a bit salty at
that. Habanero turns out to be bland chili line you get in super market
chili mix, shaped like rawitt or birds eye  definitely not habanero. Two
stars because at airport expectations are not high and I see other
servers are kind of nice, maybe it's end of bad night shift for him.
