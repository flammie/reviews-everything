# Flammie reviews: ibis Barcelona Aeropuerto Viladecans

My biggest criticism is perhaps calling this an airport hotel at all,
it's good 5 km from the airport, and depending on your taxi driver can
take between 15 to 40 minutes to get to. Otherwise it is your typical
ibis chain hotel, good and reasonably priced. When I checked in there
was only one night worker at till and few customers taking a lot of time,
if you can do your online check in and skip the queues it's recommendable.
