Unlike steamworld dig, the caves in the sequel are hand-drawn and not generated, which makes really good gameplay with well-hid secrets that are satisfying to hunt for. The game is not super long or hard, which makes it a perfect on the go playing or while you are wanting some easier games in between. The graphics are good retro-style, a bit too busy at times for my taste, so I cannot easily recognise everything that's going on on the screen and what parts of the screen are background or foreground or blocks or not. This however gets easier after first few hours of the game in most of the cave settings, the game starts in a desert that is particularly clutttered.  The music is not memorable, sound effects do their job. Good buy if you find it in discounts.&hellip; Expand
