# Flammie reviews: Hotel Star Inn Lisbon Airport

Excellent airport hotel just few minutes walk from the arrivals. The
price is decent for a nice hotel and the service is excellent. They also
serve dinner buffet but it starts only at 18 or so, so if you're flying
in from the North America for example, chances are that you're hungry
on other times and stuck with only sandwiches.
