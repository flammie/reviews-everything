# Flammie reviews: Bastard Bar

Bastard is a dive bar that plays music ranging from jazz and indie
and such to punk, rock and metal, however, even though the place looks
like more punk and metal, in the recent years it is jazz has been more
common. It is relatively small but hosts some concerts every now and
then. The draught beer is one of the cheapest in town. If there is sports
to be seen they may show it on screen, in case you like myself thought
that dive bars are good place to escape the sports.
