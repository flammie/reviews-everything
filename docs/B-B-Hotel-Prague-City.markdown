# Flammie reviews: B&B Hotel Prague-City

B&B hotel chain is nice and trustworthy chain in Central Europe at
least. It's cheap and efficient, rooms are always decent with the basics
you need. This one is quite central just a corner away from the florenc
metro station so very easily accessible by metros and trams. The breakfast
is ok, you get your breads and coffees and it's kept fresh through the
breakfast time very well. Also the room cleaning is very efficient,
my room was cleaned every time when I left for breakfast or shopping at
the morning–midday and took the dnd sign off the door within minutes.
