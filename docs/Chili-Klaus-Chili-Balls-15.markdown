# Flammie reviews: Chili Klaus Chili Balls 15

Chili Klaus Chili Balls is a chocolate covered licorice ball type of
product. It's popular in many places in central and Northern Europe but I
believe it definetely splits the opinions outside. I like the chocolate
and licorice combo, and this product with highest heat rating works
quite well indeed. The heat is very strong but develops very slowly so
you get to suck most of the chocolate before the heat starts to kick in
and there is a good flavour to the chocolate. The burn also lasts long
and overall this is only recommendable to chili enthusiasts or if you
want to shut your annoying toxic dudebro friend up.
