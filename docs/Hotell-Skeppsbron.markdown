# Flammie reviews: Hotell Skeppsbron

Hotel Skeppsbron is located at the edge of old town on a side alley. The
building is old and the rooms are in the basement, but it's relatively
cheap for the location, so the value for money is good. The check-in
time is few hours in early afternoon but luckily they can arrange self
check-in if you pay in advance. The room was quite dirty, sticky coffee
stains everywhere and the rulebook had been soaked in coffee. Free coffee
in the kitchen though. It started to be end of the summer so the AC was
just enough to be ok, I suspect it'll be hot in the summer time. Overall
a good cheap central-ish stay for one night or so.
