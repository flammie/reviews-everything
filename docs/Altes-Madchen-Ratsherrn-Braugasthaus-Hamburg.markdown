# Flammie reviews: Altes Mädchen Ratsherrn Braugasthaus Hamburg

A really nice modern brewery restaurant with great selection of beers
and great pub food to go with it. It is however always very busy, so if
you are coming with more than couple of people you will certainly want to
make a reservation. The first couple of times I visited them the service
was a bit slow, but it seems they've improved a lot on that and the last
time I visited  I noticed no delays in our service at all.
