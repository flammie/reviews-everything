# Flammie reviews: 380 Grad Pizza Bar

Newly opened pizza slice restaurant, they offer interesting selection of
pizzas and it's quite ideal for us who work in the neighbourhood for a
lunch place. Pizzas are very nice quality and like said, it's not only
pineapples and ham, but you get more interesting varieties like peaches
and walnuts, which I really like. The food comes fast and the restaurant
atmosphere is nice and relaxed.
