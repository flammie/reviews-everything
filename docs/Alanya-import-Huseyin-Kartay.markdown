# Flammie reviews: Alanya import Huseyin Kartay

Alanya is the biggest foreign food market in Tromsø and contains most of
the spices and ingredients you will need for various Asian cuisines. Good
selection of noodles and spices, some various fresh fruits, herbs and
chilies as well as sauces, cans and frozen meats and dumplings. Also
some imports of e.g. North American candies and crisps etc.
