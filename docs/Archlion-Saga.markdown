# Flammie reviews: Archlion Saga

It's very basic kemco JRPG, nice little story, decent music and basic battle
system. Given that you can probably pick it up for few euros it's ideal to play
on one or two airplane trips and layovers, it's lightweight and easy to pick up
where you left if you get interrupted. Rather linear and simple, if I didn't
know it's one of kemco's showelware JRPGs could've thought it's some students
first attempt at writing a game, it's quite naive like that but it works and
keeps you entertained for few hours.

★★★★★★★☆☆☆ (7 out of 10)
