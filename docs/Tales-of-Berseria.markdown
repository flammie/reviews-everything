I am not a long time fan of the series but have playedTales of Berseria is a part of tales series, an action rpg with specific battle system. I am not a long time fan of the series but have played few entries to know that this works mostly like others. The plot is very captivating, good enough to keep you wanting to play more and more. The battle system is something I am not a big fan of, it is slightly complicated, based on combos and stuns, but for me it always ends up in rather uninteresting button mashing, Tales have also a lot of collecting and crafting, for my taste a bit too much and the effect of crafting is so limited that I get bored of doing anything besides some +1 for all equipment to get the basic bonuses. The story and good characters really save a lot but it wasn't enough for me to complete game or do end game hunting, it's a decent buy in the discount sales.&hellip; Expand
