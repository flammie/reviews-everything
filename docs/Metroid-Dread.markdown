# Flammie reviews: Metroid: Dread


Metroid dread is the newest 2d metroid. Based on classical metroid formula it's
a very tight package from beginning to end, everything is very well designed,
the maps, the items and skills you unlock and so on. A bit too linear at times
in that some paths are blocked randomly to guide you in the right direction but
that is probably a good thing for most beginners at least, and you eventually
get to backtrack and collect the hidden items with the skills gained. The only
unique new thing that is supposed to be the "dread" part is the kind of stealth
and escape part when fighting against the emmi bots, for me it was kind of
boring, you retry the emmi parts generally 1-10 times to find the correct path
and then it's done, but I'm not a horror fan so I probably just miss that point;
for the comparison I do find the bots in breath of the wild more menacing. The
music and sounds are great. The controls are perfect, perhaps a bit tricky with
triggers at times but in general if you make mistake it's on you and not bad
controls. The boss fights are challenging but all have recognisable patterns to
learn so it really is all about learning the boss patterns, rather than having
lightning reflexes and good luck, which is one of the main point that sets it
apart from poorly designed indie metroidvanias.
