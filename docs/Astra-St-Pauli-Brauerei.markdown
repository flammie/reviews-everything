# Flammie reviews: Astra St. Pauli Brauerei

It's a modern style brewery restaurant and sports bar. I like astra's
beer alright and would have liked to like this place as well, however,
it is mainly targeted for tourists I would say. That's not bad in itself,
but having one of the most expensive astra's on Reeperbahn means that as
a local I won't visit there very often, while it offers little to justify
the price. The service is really slow, we had to wait for first drink
for good ten minutes, and after drinking that we never got second one
and decided to leave after good half an hour. That is after the waiter
asked every single table around us for orders and clearly saw us sitting
there with empty glasses. We actually had to walk up to counter even to
get the bill. The decorations are nice ok and that's worth 2 stars.
