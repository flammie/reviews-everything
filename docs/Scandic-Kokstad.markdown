# Flammie reviews: Scandic Kokstad

Scandic Kokstad is a great airport hotel from scandic chain, accessible
by tram few stops from the airport and a bit of a walk. The price is ok,
maybe a bit expensive for just an airport hotel, the rooms are nice and
the breakfast is just a standard hotel breakfast, was a bit crowded when
we were there but staff opened up extra space so it wasn't a big problem.
