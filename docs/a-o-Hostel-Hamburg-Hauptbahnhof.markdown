# Flammie reviews: a&o Hostel Hamburg Hauptbahnhof

A&O hostels is a trustworthy chain for hotels, this location is one
of the two near central railway station, a bit of a walk from actual
central station but nothing too bad. When the u1 is running there is a
ubahn stop nearby as well and busses get you there too. The price is a
bit high for what it is, also as the shared kitchen is quite horrific,
in a downstairs bunker in post-apocalyptic room that doesn't invite
confidence. We came early in the morning in hopes to store our bags
in baggage locker but the shared baggage locker is behind a door that
only has one key and someone had ran away with the key, added to that
the staff didn't seem to care about it all so it was a rather mediocre
experience from otherwise good hostel chain.
