# Flammie reviews: Spielbudenplatz

The area in middle of Reeperbahn hosts all the nice food truck festivals
and such little events and is very nice for that. Plenty of seats but
can get crowded depending on the event of course. As most commonly events
are for drinking it's good to know there's a decent public toilet for 50
cents under the street and free to use public urinals at the end. However,
Hamburg weather is not too good for street festivals.
