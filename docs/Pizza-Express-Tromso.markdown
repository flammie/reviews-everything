# Flammie reviews: Pizza Express Tromsø

We have ordered from here a couple of times, it seems that it often
takes quite a long time, up to two three hours, and we literally live
next door. The pizzas are rather mediocre, very greasy, but I think
they could be good for hangovers or heavy drinking. Most of the times
we have ordered drinks or extras that have been forgotten and delivered
afterwards. Last time pizzas were two hours late we tried ringing and
nobody answered, probably better to prefer other places.
