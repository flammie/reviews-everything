In the game, you control the ball and an ant as well as flippers as a main mechanic, and this works surprisingly well. The walking / moving has a bit of slowness to it which works well in the actual pinball-like sections but gets slightly frustrating when having to walk long distances, it is not very accurate or pleasant to control. For that point though, the game is only a few hours long, which is for me exactly the point where I felt that this control scheme is starting to feel frustrating for the minor part of the game. Few other instances of frustrating control schemes appear towards the end of the game, but are used sparingly enough that you can kind of feel like you've mastered them rather than that you are fighting against them. The story is nice, interesting enough to stay focused. The graphics are OK, nothing special but nothing bad either, the same can be said for music, all in all, well worth a purchase just to experience the unique idea. If it's ever to have a sequel though, I would expect few fine tunings.&hellip; Expand
