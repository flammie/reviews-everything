# Flammie reviews: T.G.I. Fridays - Oslo Airport

It's a really bad airport restaurant version of tgif, you wouldn't want
to go there but often you have few extra hours and Oslo airport really
doesn't have that much choice. The chaos starts from the entrance, you
are advised to wait at a sign for someone to take you to the tables but it
takes on average 15 minutes for someone to come. The staff do not know if
there are free tables somewhere and tell you to go around looking anyways,
not taking you to the tables or anything. Ordering is only from the bar,
with table number, so if you are travelling alone you are probably screwed
cause you aren't allowed to leave your luggage at table unattended and if
you leave your table to order someone will snatch it. Usually about half
of  the menu seems to be sold out. Nacho starter is literally a handful
of nacho chips with ok tomato smash and avocado smash on the side, you'd
be better off and cheaper just buying bag of doritos from airport duty
free. Jalapeno poppers are decent but quite small portion. The service
staff is nice but they seem overwhelmed and don't know the table numbers
or anything, they need either more staff or better education at least.
