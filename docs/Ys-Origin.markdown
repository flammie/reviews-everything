This is the first ys game I played, so I cannot compare to others, but it is a basic very linear action RPG, with a quite thin plot. You climb a tower in a mostly linear fashion, few cut scenes here and there to tell a plot. The gameplay is good and battles and boss battles are well-made, based on skill and pattern recognition more than quick reflexes and sheer luck. The music is fantastic, I might just get the soundtrack to listen to. It's a very short game with some 10 hours of game play, though two heroes to select from so probably a bit of replay value as well, and some extra modes to unlock.&hellip; Expand
