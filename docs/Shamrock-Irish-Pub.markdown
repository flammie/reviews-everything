# Flammie reviews: Shamrock Irish Pub

This is pretty average European sports bar that shows some Irish sports
and serves Guinness as well. I'm not that much into sports so it's not
anything special for me, if you look for Irish bars there are better
options in Hamburg with more Irish feel to them in my opinions.
