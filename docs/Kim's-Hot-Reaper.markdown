# Flammie reviews: Kim’s Hot Reaper

Kim's Hot Reaper is a spicy crisp from Norwegian(?) Kim's brand, as you
can probably guess it being a large brandname in Norway, the spiciness
is not particularly there despite the number of warning signs and the
allusion to reaper does not refer to Carolina reaper's in the first
place. What we have is what most of the world would call regular chili
flavoured crisps, it has a bit of salty spiciness in it but if it com from
a chili or salt is anyone's guess. As I personally am not a big fan of
crisps, this is nice enough that I would eat it but would not buy again.
