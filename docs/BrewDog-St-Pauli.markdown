# Flammie reviews: BrewDog St. Pauli

First of all, excellent food and excellent beers, prime location and
it's very well structured, so there's lot of seats inside and outside,
it's really nice to have a good large craft beer bar in Hamburg
finally. However, since it is a new restaurant there seems to be a lot
of starting problems, while the service is really nice, the kind of
modern hipstery nice where they sit in your table to chat with you,
it's not well organised yet and the server run rounds with foods and
beers never knowing where it's going. I've already visited a few times
and the waiting time for anything is a bit long, though in Germany one
gets used to this. Last time though, I went for dinner with my partner,
and the experience was really not good. First of all when the food
came, I had no beer left and server refused to take order, so I ate
the whole dish without drink, i know some Germans like to do it like so
but I do not. After eating the same server was able to take the order,
so we stayed for \"another beer\". After waiting with obviously no beers
and no food on the table for about 30 minutes, another server just came
to the table to say the beer will be there immediately, this is alright
sometimes you forget orders in a busy bar like that... except it wasn't,
so we waited another approx. 30 minutes, with no beer and no food on
the table, the server comes asking us for an order (which we had made
and not received at all), unfortunately after almost an hour without
anything to drink I was not in very polite mood, so I asked for a check
instead. In summary, this will definitely be a five star place but only
if the staff gets trained and the table service organised.
