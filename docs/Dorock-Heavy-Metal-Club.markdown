# Flammie reviews: Dorock Heavy Metal Club

Dorock is an old metal bar and venue near taksim, they usually seem to
have some concerts or goings on every day but sometimes there might be
tickets required to get in so you should check in advance. It's especially
good for finding local bands and seeing concerts, it can be hard to just
sit and talk with your friends otherwise, although there is an outside
area for that too.
