# Flammie reviews: Suikoden

Suikoden is a traditional JRPG with a army-collecting mechanic that was
unique at the time. The gplot is quite good classical JRPG story. The
progress has typical pacing and direction giving problems of the era so
it may be a bit annoying to play if you are used to modern games. You
are often left unsure of where to go next and the plot sometimes runs
fast forward while you would want to stand back and collect more side
quests. Suikoden's unique idea is that it was the first of its kind
in collecting the army kind of game and it does quite good job at
kickstarting the genre. The game is a bit on the short side and mostly
easy, though there are some difficulty spikes. The leveling up mechanism
is balanced so that there is practically no grinding, even when you want
to level up dozens of characters... though if you want everyone to have
their own equipments it's a bit more collecting.
