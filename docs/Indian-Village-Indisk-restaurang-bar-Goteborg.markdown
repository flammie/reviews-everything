# Flammie reviews: Indian Village - Indisk restaurang & bar Göteborg

Indian Village is a nice indian resetaurant little off the way in
Göteborg, the food is only a bit mild for Indian but perfectly tasty
and actually a bit spicier than average Indian food experience in Europe,
so not much to complain here. The restaurant has a nice local restaurant
feel to it. The food is affordable and portions are good size.
