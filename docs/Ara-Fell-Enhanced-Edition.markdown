The story is good enough to keep you interested, a bit of cliches but that isAra fell is a good classical jrpg with basic turn-based combat. The story is good enough to keep you interested, a bit of cliches but that is totally in style of 16-bit jrpg's of the golden era. The battle system is relatively simple with attack and handful of spells. The game lacks a bit of polish, I think I picked a hard difficulty level but nevertheless the 99 % of the fights quite soon turned into throwing same set  of spells without much thinking, rest few boss fights making up weird difficulty spikes. The lack of polish shows up rarely in the game itself, some collisions are programmed wrong and you can walk through walls here and there with few cases of walking through invisible paths also being required to advance in the game. Definitely worth picking up if you haven't played a classic turn-based jrpg in awhile and from discount sales.&hellip; Expand
