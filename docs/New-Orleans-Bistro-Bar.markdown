# Flammie reviews: New Orleans Bistro & Bar

You wouldn't typically expect much from an airport restaurant, though
arlanda has quite a few nice ones too. This is not one of them, I
have no idea why it's named New Orleans or bistro, I wonder if they
do either. So, I ordered nachos and my friend had a burger, and what I
get after ten minutes of waiting is a small plate, on which the server
has dumped a handful of corn chips out of the bag and a tiny cup of red
sauce that could have been any discount store salsa, all of this cold,
so apparently the waiter took ten minutes to open a bag of crisps and jar
of salsa. The portion was so laughable, at a price of 10 euros, that we
were convinced it was a free appetiser, which turns out it wasn't. The
hamburger, my friend tells, was just ok, more of a fast-food restaurant
quality than anything from a \"bistro\" I'd say, but I don't know for
sure. The atmosphere in the restaurant is what it is usually at airports,
it's upstairs in the busy hub of Arlanda in sky city, next to the toilet
where people queue partly towards the restaurant area, but I guess it
cannot be avoided. In conclusion, prefer any other restaurant around sky
city, or if you have chance going airside, most terminals have wonderful
restaurants in them. If the restaurant owner or chef reads this, please
see google images for \"nachos\", or, say \"New Orleans cuisine\".
