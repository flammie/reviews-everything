# Flammie reviews: Chili Klaus Spicy Peanuts 6

Chili Klaus is a brand of spicy foods that is kind of available in
Norway, at least easier than most foreign brands. Chili Klaus himself
is a youtube person known for eating super spicy food, for that reason
it is particularly odd how mild most of his products are. The strength
6 suggest it should be relatively spicy already, but in fact it is not
that much over storebrand chili nuts. The nuts and the spicemix itself
are decent quality but it is not worth paying extra shipping and higher
price point in general as you can just grab any store brand chili nuts
in kilogram bag for half the price.

On the spicyness: Chili Klaus uses their own "Wind Force" scale, the number 6
in the name means the spicyness is 6 out of 15, or below average, which seems
more accurate than my initial impression, nevertheless, the flavour is also
nothing to write home about so my scoring stands.
