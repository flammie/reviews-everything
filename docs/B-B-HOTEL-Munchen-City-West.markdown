# Flammie reviews: B&B HOTEL München City-West

B&B is a good hotel chain in Germany, a cheap concept with minimal
services and good quality rooms. It's a bit further from the city center
than I thought looking at the map but since the whole city was booked
out for Easter it was decent choice. The service in the whole chain is
minimal like I said but the reception was still quite unnice I would
say, best to check-in yourself at the machine, it's actually easier than
digging out and reciting the reservation numbers anyways.
