# Flammie reviews: CASA INFERNO - Pizza Restaurant

Casa Inferno serves authentic Italian style pizzas, and for that it is
definetely the best pizza restaurant in town. The pizzas are absolutely
top quality and the selection is good. They also serve some local craft
beers on tap, and selection of wines. The price is slightly higher than
the cheapest pizza places in town but it is well worth it. The restaurant
is nice and cosy and service is fast and friendly.
