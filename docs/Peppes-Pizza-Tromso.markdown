# Flammie reviews: Peppes Pizza - Tromsø

This is a popular pizza chain around here, as a recent immigrant I can
also see why. They make good American style pizza, which is surprisingly
rare to come by in Europe in general. The atmosphere at the restaurant
was nice and service friendly. The price is decent for Norwegian standards
and selection of pizzas is good.
