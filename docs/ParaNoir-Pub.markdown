# Flammie reviews: ParaNoir Pub

It's a metal bar in Budapest and for that it is already worth visiting
if you like metal. Closes early so it probably is best for early beers
before heading to concert or somewhere. The atmosphere is good, there
are many tourists but also locals here. The service can be  a bit of
hit and miss, some servers make you feel foreigners aren't welcome, and
there is a group of bartenders' friends hanging out at the bar staring
at you all every now and then. And also they sold us beers few minutes
before closing time and just told us they were closing after we got the
beers which was just strange.
