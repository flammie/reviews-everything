# Flammie’s Tromsø travel guide

Tromsø is a city in north Norway, that I live in and that is a touristic
destination. It is a small city even in Norwegian scale, so there is not awfully
much to do or see; if you are visiting for a week instead of googling for good
bars and restaurants you could try every single one of them.

## Restaurants

* [Casa Inferno](CASA-INFERNO-Pizza-Restaurant.html), Italian style pizza,
  highly recommend
* [Peppes Pizza](Peppes-Pizza-Tromso.html), Norwegian chain for US style
  pizza, I'd recommend this for anyone who prefers USA over Italian style
* [Food Court](Food-Court-Tromso.html), street foods
* [Parrilla](Parrilla-Restaurant.html), hangover kebabs, not mexican
* [Pastafabrikken](Pastafabrikken.html), actually decent pastadishes, not sure
  why I don't come here more often
* [Pizza Express](Pizza-Express-Tromso.html), hangover pizzas, long delivery
  times
* [Tang's restaurant](Tang-s-restaurant.html), old European style Chinese food

## Shops

In Norway, the national super markets are mostly all the same: Coop, Spar, Kiwi,
Rema 1000 etc. have about the same selection and prices. There are few discount
stores but they aren't too exciting. The main shopping place for cheap and
healthy, quality foods is "foreigner" markets.

* [Alanya](Alanya-Import-Huseyin-Kartay.html), biggest "foreign" food market
* [Internasjionalt Food](International-Foodcenter-AS.html), smaller
  international food store but has slightly different skew and prices, worth
  checking out
* Coop Prix (e.g. [Strandkanten](Coop-Prix-Strandkanten-Nord.html)), coop's
  smaller more expensive shops
* Kiwi (e.g. [Fagereng](KIWI-Fagereng.html)), just another supermarket, claims
  to be cheap but isn't
* Extra (e.g. [Bjerkaker](Extra-Bjerkaker.html)), basic supermarket
* Joker (e.g. [Storgata](Joker-Storgata.html)), somewhere between kiosk (bodega)
  and small convenience store, expensive

## Bars

* [Ølhallen](Olhallen.html), oldest and biggest craft beer selection, nice but
  very filled with tourists
* [Mikrobryggeriet / Balthazar](Tromso-Mikrobryggeri-Balthazar-vinbar.html),
  great craft beer bar
* [Agenturet](Agenturet-Ol-og-Vinbar.html), another good craft beers
* [Bastard](Bastard-Bar.html), dive bar with cheap beers, sometimes gigs
* [Cafe Sånn](Cafe-Sann.html), nice craft beers
* [Nyt](Nyt.html), nice and cosy for a pint and lunch
* [Solid](Solid.html), generic bar

## Festivals

* Bukta festival, for some rock and pop in the city
* Rakettnatt, maybe hip hop and such?
* [Riddu Riđđu](Riddu-Riddu-Festivala.html) Indgigenous festival a local bus journey away
