# Flammie reviews: Domino's Pizza Hamburg Innenstadt

Domino's is a chain restaurant, yes, however, in Germany it only acquired
another chain a few years ago. This is a far cry from the quality of
domino's in e.g. UK and Ireland if you're used to that, but prices are
the same. Pizzas are almost always undercooked, actually mostly raw dough
even. A lot of times the pizzas even lack in flavour, I'm not sure how
they achieve to do that since the ingredients should be more tasty. You
can get better pizzas by microwaving freezer pizza from local supermarket,
this domino's is best avoided at all costs.
