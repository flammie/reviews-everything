# Flammie reviews: EXKi Roissy CDG TERM 2G

Well, Exki is a chain that sells pre-packaged salads and triangle
sandwiches, it is rather unfortunate that at this time it is the only
place serving food in terminal 2G because while I generally don't mind
Exki stuff, it's not substantial enough for the times where you have 3
hour overlay and are hungry, as often happens when you have to travel
on airplanes for a day or two in a row... especially problematic since
this terminal is 15 minutes bus journey away from other parts of the
airport. But the service is nice and the sandwiches and salads are what
you'd expect albeit at airport prices.
