# Flammie reviews: Holy Taco

A really nice modern style taco restaurant, and I was positively surprised
that the flavours seemed quite authentic and not too toned down for
German taste as happens with many other places. Excellent selection of
tacos with number of vegan and vegetarian options that were in my opinion
even better than the meat options, in any case altogether good tacos. The
service was fast and nice. The price point is a bit steep, especially
since you can order single tacos, and you will always want one more, it
adds up very quickly ;-). The interior of the restaurant has very modern
and trendy style, I'd say, that is actually not so common in Hamburg,
so I enjoyed it very much. Will come again and definitely recommend.
