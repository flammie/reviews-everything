# Flammie reviews: Pastafabrikken

The restaurant is large and serves a variety of pasta dishes. I find
the pasta is well-made, not overcooked as would be common in Nordic
countries. The available options at the time I visited were quite good,
nothing surprising or special but you'll find your favorites likely. The
flavours of the pasta dishes were just a touch on the underseasoned side,
but nothing too critical. There is a lot of room in the restaurant and so
probably easy to find tables at most times. At the time of writing they
had a mobile-app based ordering only, it is not very ideal for immigrants
or tourists, but we managed. Otherwise, I find app-based ordering and
paying quite nice an idea.  Altogether it is a good choice for pasta.
