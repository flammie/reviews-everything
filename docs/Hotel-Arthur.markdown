# Flammie reviews: Hotel Arthur

This must be one of the worst hotel experiences I've had in my life. A
supposedly three star hotel, I arrived late at night for one night stay
booked via hotel price comparing website. When I arrived I was offered a
room in the top floor that had a broken toilet, was smelly and unclean,
the walls were cracked and the paint cracking of, in a word, disgusting. I
went downstairs to ask about the broken toilet and was faced with totally
indifferent attitude, they just shrugged and went to ask their colleague
\"what's the deal with the toilets in room 8XX\". After a while I did
however get \"an upgrade\" to a room with a working toilet, it was just
about as unclean, old, worn out and disgusting as the previous one, but
good enough for one night. If you check the reviews of this hotel from
other services you might see their representatives responses along the
lines \"we offer these bad quality rooms only through these discount
channels, book on our website\", this, however is a practice that is
not only totally unusual and bad for the reputation of the hotel, it's
borderline illegal in Finland.
