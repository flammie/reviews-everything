# Flammie reviews: Sleep&Fly

This airport hotel is ideal for overnight stays when travelling with
wizzairs and ryanairs flights in silly times of the night, a five minute
walk from the airport and much more affordable than the chain hotel next
to the airport. Rooms are ok, a bit old but not dirty or anything and
showers also work well, electric sockets are sometimes a bit out of the
way, that's the main thing you notice the oldness from.
