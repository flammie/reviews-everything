# Flammie reviews: Food Court Tromso

Food court tromsø is a restaurant that serves decent fast food in Tromsø
city center. The restaurant is by the street in shopping centre, it's fast
food style so good for grabbing a bite or getting food to go, wouldn't
recommend for dates or hanging out for longer time like such. Kebabs,
falafels are ok, nothing super special but not bad either. I quite liked
the chicken burger. For me this would be ideal for a stop going to or
from pubs maybe, that sort of thing.
