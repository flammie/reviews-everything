# Flammie reviews: Green Papaya

Nice Asian style food with good atmosphere. You'll get your curries and
thai salads with neat modern presentation, most of the food is tasty,
but definitely toned down for German taste, as you'd find in vast majority
of places in Hamburg. I've mostly gone for lunch times and the prices on
lunch menu are nice, they have a weekly menu but it seems to be mostly the
basic curries and so forth anyways, a good safe bet but nothing special.
