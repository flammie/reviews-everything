# Flammie reviews: The Baby Goat Barn

Baby goat barn is a craft beer bar and pizza place near reeperbahn. Nice
craft beers and the vegan pizza was good as well. The service concept
is a bit confusing, the tables have signs saying something about table
service sometimes or something like that, we sat in an empty restaurant
without anyone serving us for quite a while, only when we were leaving
someone from the bar shouted at us, so that was strange.
