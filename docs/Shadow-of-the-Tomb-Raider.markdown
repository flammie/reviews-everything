The game plays well and the progression is well-balanced mix of shooting or stealth sections, puzzles and platforming, talking with NPC's and quick time event style running action sequences. Most of these are well implented, and allow different play styles with good difficulty level. The most annoying I find  are the quick-time eventish running scene where you are basically always running from something and have to react to falling things and stuff, they aren't real QTEs so there's no button prompts but you still have to memorise what do on each step and it's usually not obvious at all so it just becomes annoying. The camera is sometimes quite bad and especially swimming is torture. Other than that there is no big problems in the game. The music is top notch and the voice acting is passable. I kind of like using native languages for npc's but calling it immersive is quite absurd, that's not quite how it works in real world.&hellip; Expand
