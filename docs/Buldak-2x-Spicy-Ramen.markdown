# Flammie reviews: Buldak 2x Spicy Ramen

Samyang's Hek Buldak Spicy 2x Ramen is probably one of the most well-known
spicy ramens of the time. It is quite spicy even for experienced chili
eaters, however tasty enough for even people who don't like spicy
food to sometimes admit that it is not just pure heat in it. For this
reason it has become very popular spicy food eating challenge in the
early 2000's internet. While most of the internet videos of the topic
are quite ridiculous indeed, ranging from toxic masculinity showdowns
to other kinds of nasty reaction videos, the noodles are actually very
good by flavour and the slight bit too much of heat is a nice thing for
any chiliheads' lunch menu every now and then. A must try for everyone ;-)
