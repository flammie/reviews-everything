# Flammie reviews: Magic Hotel Solheimsviken

Magic Hotel in Solheimsviken is a good hotel a few tram stops from city
centre and affordable (by Norwegian standards). The rooms were great, only
thing I found missing was the fridge, as I like to keep few things like
cold drinks and sandwich ingredients for late night snacks, but there is
a super market and a gas station downstairs. Breakfast was okay, I'm not a
fan of Norwegian cheese or salami or bread or watery coffee but otherwise
it's your standard hotel breakfast buffet, a bit crowded at times.
