# Flammie reviews: Hotel Belle Epoque Beach

Hotel Belle Epoque is an ok hotel near the beach in Varna and short
walk from the railway station. The hotel is not too expensive given
that it is very near to the beach, but the hotel's concept is a bit
confused. Because it is near beach you can hear the beach parties through
the night, but hotel and their booking site is full of warnings that
you are not allowed to eat or drink in the rooms, etc. etc., and so,
as if it is more aimed to not the people who'd visit the beach and
party. The service is quite rude altogether. we arrived half day late
due to train delays, during breakfast hours so we tried to go have some
breakfast after the ordeal only to have rude lady deny the breakfast
for us because we didn't pre-book it (I thought it was included since
it said so in booking.com) and then she proceeded to laugh at us while
shooing us away. The pictures on booking sites do not resemble anything
that this hotel has. I'd recommend looking at other hotels rather than
this one even if they are few euros more expensive.
