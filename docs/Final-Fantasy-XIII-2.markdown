# Flammie reviews: Final Fantasy XIII-2

Final Fantasy XIII-2 is an JRPG with a turn-based-ish battle system, it
continiues on FF XIII's paradigm shift automatic battle system which has it's
good and bad sides, but is implemented massively better in this game, and makes
much nicer battles where you feel more in control of your losses and victories.
The time-travel theme with slightly less linear progression also fixes the other
major problem in FF XIII making this game a bit of a hidden gem, since many
probably gave up because of the predecessor. Actually one of the only real
problem in the game is that some of the progress is hidden behind hard to find
hidden treasures and side quests, so you may end up stuck too often. The story I
find was quite good and the graphics and music are amazing as always. The game
also had some quick time event stuff but that didn't really matter for me one
way or another.

★★★★★★★★★☆ (9 out of 10)
