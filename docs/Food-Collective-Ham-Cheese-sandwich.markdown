This is a pre-packed sandwich from Danish company called food collective.
It is much smaller than your average triangle sandwich, and really
low quality.  The cheese is not real cheese but some kind of plastic
cheese product.  Ham is passable but cheap. The bread is also cheap but
not the absolute worst.  There is supposed to be a sauce inside as well,
it probably just mixes into cheese so well that is unrecognisable, since
the plastic cheese is kind of liquidy saucy in itself.  This product
has over a year's shelf life so I assume it was meant for in-flight
services and big organisations rather than sold in single packages in
coop extra Norway.
