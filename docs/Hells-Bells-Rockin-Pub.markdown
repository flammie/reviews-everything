# Flammie reviews: Hells Bells Rockin' Pub

Hells bells is the traditional metal / rock pub in Prague, a must visit
for most metal travellers I would say. The music is nice, a bit generic
often but surely the kind of hit songs most will like. The bar is often
mostly full of tourists and visitors so depending on what you want it
may be good or bad. There are several beer options and the service is
good and efficient.
