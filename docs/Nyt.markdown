# Flammie reviews: Nyt

The restaurant serves nice smaller foods in the daytime. The atmosphere
and the service are enjoyable. The place is also a decent bar in the
evening hours, and they have an upstairs which often has space in
otherwise busy and crowded times. The selection of beers is good. The
prices are quite expensive but it's not unexpected in central Tromsø.
