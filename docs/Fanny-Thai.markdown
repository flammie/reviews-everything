# Flammie reviews: Fanny Thai

It's on a street with a number of other restaurants of various Asian
countries, so highly competitive  neighbourhood for that, and I have to
say others I've visited have been nicer. The food is basic tasty thai
food, nothing special but not bad either. Service however I didn't mind,
a bit of long wait times, rather unfriendly, and for example I ordered
a lamb dish, and the waitress brought in duck, and when I said that I
don't think I ordered this, she started arguing with us in quite rude
manner. So total lack of basic level of service just gives no reason
to come back when there's at least two equally good or better thai food
restaurants in 50 metre range.
