# Flammie reviews: Hotel Stern

I was positively surprised, it's a cheap one star hotel a bit of a way
away from the city center, or just 3 tram stops, but it's in decent
condition and rooms are neat. Of course you don't have your own toilet
or shower, but that's ok for the price. The neighbourhood doesn't have
much, but there's like a cheap food store and few local pubs there. The
staff is really nice and helpful.
