# Flammie reviews: Bambi galore

It's a concert venue for smaller gigs, a bit away from reeperbahn and
city centre for sure, but as metro gets you few hundred metres away,
it's all good. The beer is cheaper and entrance fees typically too. The
place is small though, the main venue is a basement dive bar kind
of thing, though I believe this is some kind of youth club centre in
principle. There's a bigger venue upstairs (Kulturpalast) although the
concert ads and tickets may use either name for either venue. There's
no sitting places! Me like most of the metal crowd we are getting too
old to stand up for extended periods of time.
