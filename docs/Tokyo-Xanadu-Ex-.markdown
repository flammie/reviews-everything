# Flammie reviews: Tokyo Xanadu Ex+

Tokyo Xanadu EX+ is an action RPG with an almost visual novel like
backstory in a Tokyo school. The story bears great similiarity to Persona
for sure, but so do 100s of other anime stories related to schools in
Japan and so on. The story is quite well written and I especially liked
that most of the characters are quite well written and have a progression
arc. For many people the game might be too story heavy but I find the
balance between fighting and story actually quite perfect. The battle
system is quite complex and makes use of most buttons on the joypad
including directional pad arrows, as I am not very good in ARPGs in
general I often forgot to use half the special moves or accidentally
used one when trying to switch characters or open menu, however, the
normal difficulty is easy enough to enjoy the game anyways. Only the
final boss fight required extra googling of instructions. Music is ok,
and sounds too., and so is graphic, nothing super spectacular but works.

> *Score*: ★★★★★★★★☆☆ (8 out of 10)
