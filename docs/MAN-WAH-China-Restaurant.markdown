# Flammie reviews: MAN WAH China Restaurant

A positive surprise with more authentic style Chinese than your average
places around Hamburg.  I ordered dumplings and Mapo tofu and both
were quite good. The dumplings had just the right texture and Mapo tofu
exactly the tastes I like it for. Noteworthy is it says lightly spicy
on the menu and it I'd indeed very mild, but this can be fixed a bit
with the sauces. Place was very full despite I'd being there early for
dinner time, so be sure to come early if you want a good table.
