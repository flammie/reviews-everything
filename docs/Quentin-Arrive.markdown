# Flammie reviews: Quentin Arrive

It's good value for the money, located very centrally. I had a room with
a shared bathroom, and it was rather small and reminded me of a prison
cells (in Finland) a bit. The building is old but apart from the narrow
staircase there aren't any real problems, showers etc. work and bed is
soft. Basically it's ok for a few days and excellent price for Amsterdam,
maybe if you get a room with a bathroom it's even better. The service
staff were very friendly too.
