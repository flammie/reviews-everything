# Flammie reviews: Food

Not many people know but I consider myself a bit of a foodie. Not super serious
but it is one thing I look forward to when travelling or just everyday, trying
new food is fun. This section is food products, for restaurants see maps /
places (forthcoming). Also, this is not recipes, just products, I might build a
recipe site separately someday because I cannot stop myself from wasting time
like that lol. But here's food stuffs you can buy from shops. A lot come from
Asian markets because I like that.
