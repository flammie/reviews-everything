# Flammie reviews: Solid

Solid is a good bar that is nice for few afterwork beers or meeting with
friends for a pint. The atmosphere is nice and laid back and there's
plenty of room. Have not tried it in Friday nights though. The bar staff
is nice too. Apart from that it really is just a bar with nothing special
going for it.
