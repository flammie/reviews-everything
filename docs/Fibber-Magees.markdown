# Flammie reviews: Fibber Magees

It's the go-to metal and rock bar in Dublin, good beer and nice
atmosphere. Arranges gigs and events every now and then. The service
is nice, of course Friday nights the bars can get crowded but nothing
too bad. The music is usually metal and rock that is suitable for most
people i.e. nothing extreme either way, but I think there is a jukebox
when it's not a concert night.
