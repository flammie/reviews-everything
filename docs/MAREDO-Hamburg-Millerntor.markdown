# Flammie reviews: MAREDO Hamburg Millerntor

This is a German chain restaurant for steaks and the overall quality is
decent, however, there's nothing that really stands out either. The prices
are average, so not cheap but not expensive either. The place and decor
is nice, but nothing special. The biggest problem is, that the service is
super slow, even for German standards, we had to wait quite a long time
for every step of the way, from getting the menus to ordering to actually
receiving the foods and drinks, but of course the most irritating is that
we had to wait over half an hour for the bill, and we  asked three times
for it. And the restaurant wasn't even busy. The servers were nice and
friendly, so I think it's more of a problem of how it's organised or not
organised than anything. In any case, even this chain restaurant has a
sister chain of steak restaurants that has more interesting options in
same price range and nearby locations, and in general any other steak
restaurant nearby will probably be a better choice in some way.
