                                        Trials of mana is complete remake of Seiken Densetsu 3, an action rpg from SNES era that never arrived to west until 2d mana collection andTrials of mana is complete remake of Seiken Densetsu 3, an action rpg from SNES era that never arrived to west until 2d mana collection and this 3d remake. While the engine in this version has been changed to totally new, the plot and lots of dungeon design as far as I remmber remains the same, in any case, it is a good quality action rpg with good battle system, interesting plot and great musics. One of the things that must be mentioned with this version, it comes with voice acting, both English and Japanese. Do NOT turn the English voice acting on! This is probably the worst voice acting I have ever heard in my life and I have heard a lot of budget anime, eastern European dubs with one monotone voice for all characters, it's still better than this, unless you want to laugh at the sheer badness of the voice actors, avoid the English dub at all costs. The game has multiple party members to select for multiple story lines and little replay value, which is kind of cool, it is a short-ish game stil, probably worth it to play through twice.&hellip; Expand

There is basically only a few different minigames, which all boil down to multiple choice answers, whether you are selecting 1 out of 2, 1 out of 4, or some 8 out of 16 or closest answer on a scale, whether you are doing it in turns or fastest-one-wins it's not a big difference. I personally dislike the fastest one wins type of stuff but ymmv. And you can play 3 or 5 rounds, but it all doesn't matter since the last round is always a sudden death with 1 out of 2 questions that renders the rest of the game irrelevant, reminds you a bit of many american game shows. The Unfortunate thing is this is still the best trivia game on current generation consoles at least in the English market. There is also an online play mode which simply doesn't work at all. The graphics are horrible and the announcer has only a few pre-recorded boring things that get annoying fast.&hellip; Expand
