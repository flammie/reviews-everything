# Flammie Reviews: Teumsae Stir-Fried Ramen

Paldo's *Temsae Stir-Fried Ramen* spicy is a good Korean style noodle with a
decent bit of heat in it. The main spicy flavour is enjoyable, otherwise the
other flavour that is very distinguishable is the seafoody umami, that comes
from the toppings bag, which mostly contains seaweed shreds and probably other
fish flakes as well. In the cup version the instructions call for draining the
water, probably because it is supposed to be stir-fry style, however, I usually
don't bother and the soupy version is quite fine for my taste, it still has a
decent heat to it.
