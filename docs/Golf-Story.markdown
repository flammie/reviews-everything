You talk with characters, solve puzzles and fetch quests and get experience points, but mostly  golf. The game is good implementation of classical golf, i.e. not too realistic but mostly. It plays some 20 hours which is just appropriate, it starts to wear out its novelty towards the end. There are few signs that the game comes from indie studio and is a bit unpolished, sometimes losing throws you back to title screen and sometimes not, and difficulty level while mostly ok does have few bumps and jumps. Perfect fetch for discount sales.&hellip; Expand
