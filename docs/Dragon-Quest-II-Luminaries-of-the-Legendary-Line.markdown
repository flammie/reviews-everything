                                        Trials of mana is complete remake of Seiken Densetsu 3, an action rpg from SNES era that never arrived to west until 2d mana collection andTrials of mana is complete remake of Seiken Densetsu 3, an action rpg from SNES era that never arrived to west until 2d mana collection and this 3d remake. While the engine in this version has been changed to totally new, the plot and lots of dungeon design as far as I remmber remains the same, in any case, it is a good quality action rpg with good battle system, interesting plot and great musics. One of the things that must be mentioned with this version, it comes with voice acting, both English and Japanese. Do NOT turn the English voice acting on! This is probably the worst voice acting I have ever heard in my life and I have heard a lot of budget anime, eastern European dubs with one monotone voice for all characters, it's still better than this, unless you want to laugh at the sheer badness of the voice actors, avoid the English dub at all costs. The game has multiple party members to select for multiple story lines and little replay value, which is kind of cool, it is a short-ish game stil, probably worth it to play through twice.&hellip; Expand

It is an undoubted classic and the plot and the game play are as good or better than the original. The new graphics probably split opinions, I would have prefered more original style pixel art for nostalgia, this style seems to me a bit off like a clip art show from cheap asset pack, but it's still recognisable dragon quest characters. Other way to think of it, the graphical style is really similar to kemco's shovelware mobile jrpgs. The port is well-made and it's mostly nice to play with few quality of life improvements compared to the original, but few nes era annoyances are still there like having to faff about with the inventories and menus a lot. Since it's decently sold at budget title price and not full price like some other remakes on switch, it's definitely worth the money.&hellip; Expand
