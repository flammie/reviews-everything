# Flammie reviews: ibis budget Berlin Ost

I only had short night between incoming flight and morning train so
I thought not to waste too much money, and accor hotels have usually
been quite good, so I did not expect any issues even though I saw one
star classification and cheaper price, however, the experience was very
disappointing. First of all, there's no reception service available at
\"late\" hours, you are expected to have the booking code to get in,
I have never experienced this, and I checked \"late checkin\" on accor
hotels booking page, received no visible warning (maybe there was a
few words in the fineprint but otherwise page looked as usual) of this
so I had to pay the night second time. Called their service line only
to be answered by rude lady who didn't understand English very well,
shouting at us that we must buy another night. Ok, after second payment
which also broke the checkin machine totally; the screen was covered by
some windows error message about ports and stuff. We got in to the room,
which on surface looked like any ok budget ibis quality room, however,
the shower door was broken, we had to reach over through the gap in the
room to open it, only to discover that it was probably broken for a good
reason, opening the door released horrible dank smell of stagnant water,
and probably mold, into the whole room. Avoid at all costs, you'll get
better value for your money for booking  a private room in a youth hostel
in the city center.
