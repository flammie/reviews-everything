# Flammie reviews: Ocean Spray Hotel

Nice hotel just off the beach. We had the other nights in a hotel right
on the beach and this is much nicer not having to go through all the
beach things going in and out the hotel, the hotel includes subway,
which, while not really exciting a restaurant, is actually much better
than the ripoff-places on the beach-side hotels. It's still a bit pricey
for a basic hotel room but again, not as bad as on the beach-front so
highly recommendable.
