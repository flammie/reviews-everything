# Flammie reviews: Headcrash

It's a dancing floor place with a bit heavier music selection. I've
visited there a couple of times and it's been very quiet, not many
people there at all, the music's alright. They have a tablefussball
downstairs. All in all it's been a bit of letdown, but maybe because
I'm not a big fan of dancing and it's been very quiet the last times I
was there.
