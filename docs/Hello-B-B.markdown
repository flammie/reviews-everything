# Flammie reviews: Hello B&B

Nice hosts. I don't usually go to B&B's, but Utrecht is not too good with
cheap accommodation. It's some 15  minute walk from the city. But a bit of
mould on shower curtains and old lemons in kitchen jar, and you can hear
people talking in the phone I have to admit I prefer hostels and Airbnb.
