# Flammie reviews: Markthalle Hamburg

This is one of the main venues in Hamburg for semi-large rock and metal
concerts, it's nicely located near the main railway station and next to
another metro station so easily accessible. The venue has two rooms,
Marx for small gigs and bigger hall for large gigs, the former is ok
if there are not too many people but it can be hard to see the stage
otherwise, the big room has the stage lower down through the stairs so
you can almost always see the stage. The beer is a bit on the expensive
side as it is a concert venue only. Also if there are longer events,
they sell overpriced food inside, but since it's so close to railway
station your best bet is to grab something quick there when you get
hungry. The cloakroom service is fast but in a typical German way they've
overcomplicated it and it can be messy, you are required to keep a tiny
piece of paper and a huge clump  of plastic with you throughout the
night if you want your coat back. If you don't you're in for a tough time.
