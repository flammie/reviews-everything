# Flammie reviews: Nevsky Central Hotel

I lost my booking for an apartment due to phone problems, so I was walking
around in the rain when I ran into this one, it was first I asked that was
a good price and I was positively surprised of the quality, it is quite
like many popular chain hotels such as ibis. Most personnel know very
little English  as you would expect anywhere in Russia, just memorise
your numbers and greetings if you don't have time to learn more. The
breakfast included in price is quite typical hotel breakfast buffet,
I liked it. Location is very central. The only minus I can really see
is that I told my friend about the place, and he got a room and said it
was noisy at night, I don't know if he's a light sleeper or he really
got worsely located room though.
