# Flammie reviews: O'Learys Helsinki Airport

You probably know O'Learys from a lot of airports, the food quality is
quite consistent, but like with lot of other locations they have, slow
service is really an issue, and given the airport location, it's often
a deal breaker. This time I had a relatively long layover so, I arrived
around noon and connecting flight would be 6 pm so I had good time. I
decided to time the service due to previous bad experiences, and I was
still quite shocked how bad it is. I stood 15 minutes by the sign that
says \"wait to be served\" by the door, a 10 minutes between getting to
the table and getting menu, 15 minutes for a drink, good 45 minutes for my
meal and whopping 30 minutes to get a bill, which I had to ask twice. It's
a good restaurant for few beers and the wings are usually ok and fast, but
I wouldn't bother ordering anything else. Especially in Helsinki airport
you'll find oak barrel for better beers and for other foods you can just
as well use the snack eateries for faster service and just as good food.
