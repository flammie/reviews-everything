# Flammie reviews: Curry Lounge Hamburg(Thai Indische) Restaurant

Probably among the best restaurants in the cheaper Asian category in
Hamburg and quite good altogether, it's a bit away from the city center
but not that much and also just on a metro station on any case. The
restaurant from inside is surprisingly really nice too while fresh off
this neighbourhood is Mainly cheap kebab shop style.
