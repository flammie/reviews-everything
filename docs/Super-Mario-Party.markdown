The boards are not particularly innovative and minigames are mostly same old as well. Given it is still one of the only party games on switch if you ignore truly low quality shovel ware it is still worth the buy when you need party games. One of the new things included is a rafting event which seems to be geared towards younger kids and seriously non-gamers, so it might be good fit for certain audiences, other than that there is nothing here that you haven't seen before in mario parties 1-10.&hellip; Expand
