# Flammie reviews: Monster Sanctuary

Monster Sanctuary is an indie JRPG metroidvania with pokemon-style gotta catch
em all theme. Overall the game is quite well made, the graphics are decent
indie-style "pixel art", music is good and story is good enough that it's fun to
follow and has some plot twists even. The battle is very traditional JRPG style
turn based combat, quite engaging and 99 % of the game the difficulty level is
just right that keeps you interested without being too hard, where it falls down
is that last part of the game has so hard difficulty spikes that makes it nearly
impossible to complete even after googling ideal party combinations and finding
out everyone else had the same problem. The game is also quite unthankful
towards grinding, having level caps and skill trees that cannot be finished, to
top it all you will find out that grinding levels for all the monsters was total
waste of time since simply catching the monster anew when you're at max level
will give you an almost max level monster, this kind of uncommunicated things
about the main game mechanics are typical indie mistakes that I cannot score
this game more than 7, it left bad after taste.

★★★★★★★☆☆☆ (7 out of 10)
