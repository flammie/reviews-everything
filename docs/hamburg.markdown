# Flammie’s Hamburg

Hamburg is a large city in Germany, I used to live in circa 2015–2020. It is not
the biggest or most touristic city in Germany but well worth a visit and overall
a nice place to live in. The party happens mostly on **Reeperbahn**, which has
most of the nightlife and also restaurants, city centre and area around the
central station is actually more quiet even. Towards west from central station
is a shopping street and east are the gay neighbourhood and the Turkish
neighbourhood. There's also an area for bars and night life near
**Sternschanze** station, traditionally more leftwing, locals and Uni students
than Reeperbahn, which is just more tourists and stag parties. There is second
railway station in Hamburg **Altona** which was incidentally close to my office,
so there are some places mentioned near there, you usually wouldn't visit there
unless taking a train. (Notably, I lived in area that's near to being halfway
between Reeperbahn and Sternschanze, so some of the places are randomly
organised because of that).

## Restaurants

### Reeperbahn

Actually best food in Germany in night life is street kebap, most are good in
the neighbourhood, especially after beers. Reeperbahn also has food trucks and
cocktail stalls throughout the year on main street (or
[Spielbudenplatz](Spielbudenplatz.html) as it is on Google maps etc.)

* [Man Wah](MAN-WAH-Cina-Restaurant.html) good Chinese foods
* [Holy Taco](Holy-Taco.html), good tacos but high prices
* [Baby Goat Barn](The-Baby-Goat-Barn.html), decent pizza, atmosphere a bit hit
  and miss
* [Big Bull](Big-Bull-Steak-Restaurant.html), mediocre steaks
* [Dos Amigos](Dos-Amigos-Restaurantbetrieb-GmbH.html), locals' favourite, I did
  not like it
* [Kentucky Fried Chicken](Kentucky-Fried-Chicken.html), worse than average KFC,
  and bit too rowdy, avoid
* [Maredo](MAREDO-Hamburg-Millerntor.html) another local chain restaurant for
  steaks, prefer Block House over this

### Altona

* [Köz Urfa](Koz-Urfa.html) one of the best Turkish restaurants in Hamburg
* [380 Grad Pizza Bar](380-Grad-Pizza-Bar.html), nice pizza slice shop, probably
  gone already
* [Green Papaya](Green-Papaya.html) decent Thai food

### Centre

* [Fanny Thai](Fanny-Thai.html), really good Thai food but bit expensive
* [Curry Lounge](Curr-Lounge-Hamburg-Thai-Indische-Restaurant.html), nice cheap
  generic Asian
* [Block House](BLOCK-HOUSE-Jungfernstieg.html), is a nice local chain for
  steaks, decent prices but sometimes full of families and kids
* [Domino's](Domino-s-Pizza-Hamburg-Innenstadt.html) in Germany bought over and
  rebranded another chain, it's not exactly like Domino's elsewhere in Europe
  for better or worse

## Shops

* [Yuan Ye (aka the foreigner market near central
  station)](Yuan-Ye-Europa-Handels-GmbH.html), biggest(?) Asian food market in
  Central Hamburg, so best place for good and cheap
* Rewe has both smaller shops (e.g. [in the docks](REWE.html)) with few
  necessities and foods as well as larger markets (e.g. [in
  Altona](REWE-Center.html))
* Lidl and Aldi are cheaper but good
* Netto also used to be discount shop but maybe just another chain store as of
  now

## Bars

### Reeperbahn

* [Night Light](Night-Light.html), legendary metal bar
* [Lunacy](Lunacy.html), metal, punk and hardcore, sometimes other things but
  usually decent
* [Brewdog](Brewdog-St-Pauli.html), trustworthy craft beer and pub foodles
* [Astra St Pauli Brauerei](Astra-St-Pauli-Brauerei.html), overpriced and bad
  service, tourist trap
* [Irish Rover](The-Irish-Rover.html), decent Irish bar, bit off Reeperbahn
  (used to be my local-ish)

* [Indra Club](Indra-Club-64.html), venue, sometimes metal

### Sternschanze

* [Altes Mädchen](Altes-Madchen-Ratsherrn-Braugasthaus-Hamburg.html), a brewery
  restaurant, good food and beers

  metal gigs

* [Markthalle](Markthalle-Hamburg.html), venue, sometimes metal, near central
  station


## Hotels

As I lived in Hamburg I do not have huge range of experience with hotels but I
have visited it since so I know of a few.

* A & O Hostels is a trustworthy chain, one in **Reeperbahn** is actually worth
  the money even for single rooms (definitely for dorms). Ones near central
  station (e.g.  [A & O Hbf Hamburg](a-o-Hostel-Hamburg-Hauptbahnhof.html)) are
  more *meh* but cheap
* Big chains on Reeperbahn are decent but expensive, e.g. Ibis, Premier Inn

## Festivals

* [Hörnerfest](docs/Hornerfest.html), folk metal etc,
  local train trip away around Summer Solstice
* Metal Bash, classic metal, nearly in S-bahn reachable,
* Headbangers, true metal etc.
