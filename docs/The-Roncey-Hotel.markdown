# Flammie reviews: The Roncey Hotel

Current name of the hotel is West Queens Hotel Queens West... It's nicely
located next to 24 hour tram-stop in the gentrifying art district,
but it's still not quite gentrified so cheap bars are still around,
as are crazies, there seems to be some sort of a community centre for
perhaps rehab patients or so next block, so you get quite special people
hanging around in the neighbourhood. The hotel if it was in Europe would
definitely be called a hostel, it's very minimalistic service concept
at best. We stayed for a week and room wasn't cleaned even once, had to
buy our own toilet paper and so forth. The breakfast is included, but
it's basically your average few packages of sliced bread, few cartons
of juice and a termos of coffee added to the table on some of the days
and never refilled, so you'll get some leftovers at best, cold coffee
and empty butter boxes seemed to be most common for me, since I don't
have the taste for putting jams and chocolates on my bread. It smells
quite heavily of smokes and weed in the rooms, the rooms are hot and loud
(24 hour streetcars and bars nearby, no proper windows). The shower kind
of works if you give it time.  Some of the service staff don't really
seem to care about much at all, while few are nice as well. All in all,
it's among the cheapest in Toronto that is still easily reachable by
public transport and you get what you pay for.
