# Flammie reviews: Jumbo Peanut Ghost Pepper

Jumbo peanuts are available at any 7/11 in the US which makes it super
annoying for us European chili lovers since they are actually quite
good spicy chili peanuts indeed. The spiciness has the nice ghost pepper
building heat flavour that makes it very addictive if you are into your
spicy chilis, and the taste is nice otherwise as well. So far one of
the best spicy peanuts I have found and very hard to find in Europe and
prohibitively expensive to ship here as one would expect.
