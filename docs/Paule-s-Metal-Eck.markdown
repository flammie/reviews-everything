# Flammie reviews: Paule's Metal Eck

Paules metal Eck is a classic metal bar in Berlin. Good music, cheap beer
and nice people, overall good atmosphere. I've been hit by sports games
a few times coupled with no music and bad service which gives minus one
star in my books, but if you know to avoid sports events it's definitely
worth a visit for metal. Cash only.
