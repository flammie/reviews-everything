# Flammie reviews: Barba Negra

An excellent outdoors concert venue for most summer band events. Beer
is a bit more expensive than in bars, but not by a much. There's plenty
of nice parks around for pre-gaming, and some really nice bars by the
river. Depending on the show, you might be able to see it from a nearby
bridge without entrance fee, though I hear the view is sometimes blocked.
