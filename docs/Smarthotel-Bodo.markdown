# Flammie reviews: Smarthotel Bodø

Smarthotel is a chain  that has usually affordable rooms, this one
is quite centrally located near railway station at the edge of city
center, walking distance from everywhere. The rooms are always small in
smarthotels, but ok for sleeping. The breakfast is ok, basic standard
bread slices, coffee and juice and so on. The price is expensive as usual
in Norway, if my employer didn't have special prices it would probably
not be worth staying here, as there are non-discount hotels with same
price in the city. Having a block for adult sites on hotel wifi is just
absurd, like why would you bother. The service is friendly but a bit
slow at times.
