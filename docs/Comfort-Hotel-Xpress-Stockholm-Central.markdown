# Flammie reviews: Comfort Hotel Xpress Stockholm Central

Nice hotel next to bus and railway stations, very central. The service at
bar reception was nice and friendly. The room was really small though, and
a bit worn out at places, for example the fake leather at the head board
of the bed. There was no window in the room so no view but it was very
quiet even though it's over the central railway station in city centre.
