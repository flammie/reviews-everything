# Flammie reviews: Games

(Mainly console) games is one of my sparetime activities I use the most time
with. I guess I write these short reviews for myself for the most part, I replay
the games every now and then and perhaps it will come in handy to know what I
thought of the game in the past, or the same for series of games or what not.
