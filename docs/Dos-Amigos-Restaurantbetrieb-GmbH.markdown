# Flammie reviews: Dos Amigos Restaurantbetrieb GmbH

It's a very busy restaurant so the couple of times we've tried to get
in they've told us not without reservation. They do however deliver via
foodora, and so I've based my review on the delivered food. Reading
from other reviews I believe one of the main point of the restaurant
is the atmosphere, the food I got at least was good, but not anything
special. For me mexican food is something that should be full of
flavour and with a bit of spicy kick in to it, but this had neither. I
can understand if mexican flavours are toned down to German taste but
even then it should have more flavour than just mince with beans, in my
opinion. The queso was unlike any I've ever seen and I couldn't really
pinpoint what the flavour was, I didn't enjoy it but my husband found it
ok. The guacamole that I got with tacos was also ok but again lacking in
flavour, I could not taste anything besides avocado. On the plus side,
the portions were decent sized and my enchilada had lots of cheese on it,
so I didn't mind it being otherwise soggy. All in all, I would probably
order it for hangover foods, but otherwise I'll prefer other choices.
