# Flammie reviews: Metal Bar ERROR

This metal pub has always been one of my favourites, hidden in the
downstairs of inner yard of a building in non-central parts of Prague,
it didn't even used to have signage but now it does. Also the bar area is
somewhat renovated and modernised from what I remember. The music is good
as ever and nice people and bar staff. Few different beers on tap as well.
