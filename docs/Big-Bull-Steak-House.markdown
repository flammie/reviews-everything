# Flammie reviews: Big Bull Steak House

I'm slightly torn for this review, on the other hand I would want to give
more stars, but I must base my review on my experiences. I went with a
friend and my husband, and we ordered all different dishes. I ordered
fiery spicy ribs, and my friends had different steaks. As I often have
to state, I am aware that I like my spicy hot, like it would be in most
places in North America and Asia, and I am aware how different the German
taste is regards to spiciness. My friends however are more like Germans
in that they cannot handle spicy foods at all. Long story short, all
three of us tasted my fiery hot ribs and felt that it was not only not
hot at all, but the sweetness and the general taste of the sauce was so
bad that we couldn't eat the ribs at all. The ribs themselves were also
not good at all, the texture reminded me of certain microwave ribs that
you get from supermarket more than juicy succulent fall of the bone meat
ribs I would go to restaurant for are. The steaks my friends got were,
however, tasty and done to their liking. The low rating also goes for
the fact that the atmosphere of the restaurant isn't very pleasant, the
lights are very bright, the air conditioning device is broken and has
really loud background noise going on, the other customer was shouting
at his speaker phone and with the staff, all in all not a good experience
for me and maybe ok for my friends.
