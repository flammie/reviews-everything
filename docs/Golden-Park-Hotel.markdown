# Flammie reviews: Golden Park Hotel

It's right next to railway station, which can be good, though most
tourists won't stay in this area, but of course public transport works
fine. The building and the lobby look real nice, and the staff was
helpful and professional. However, when you get to the rooms it is a
whole different thing, to start off, our keycard didn't work at all, and
after two retries they came with us to open the door with key instead,
and did not really apologise the inconvenience, so that was kind of not
so nice then. The room heating was for some reason set to 30 degrees
so it was quite bad inside, the floor is one of the dirtiest I ever
seen with a big white patch of gunk stuck to the carpet,  there were
stains on the walls and so on, given some hotel booking sites advertise
this as a four star experience it's really not, even by East European
standards. Another good example of how old and run-down the rooms are,
there is an actual CRT television in the room, so they probably haven't
changed this in few decades. It is among the cheaper hotels around
though, so if you don't mind the rooms, it's probably an ok deal due to
the location and all. The breakfast was also quite OK, while you could
perhaps just as well buy your breakfast from the supermarket around the
corner with fraction of the price, it worked for me.
